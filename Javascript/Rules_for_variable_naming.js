// 1 The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. It must not start witha number


// 2 the name can contain any letters, numbers, dollar signs or an underscore, Note that you must not use a dash - or a . in a variable name


// you cannot use keywords or reserved words, Keywords are words that tell the interpreter to do something, reserved words are words that may be used in a future version of Js


// All variables are case sensitive, for example, score and Score will be different how ever it is bad practice to use two varibles with the same name but different cases.


//Use a name that best describes the information the variable stores


// if your variable name is made up of more than one word use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word you can also use an underscore _ between words but not a -.
