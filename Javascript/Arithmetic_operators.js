// Arithmetic operators, maths, see book page 76.

//String operators. There is only 1 string operator  which is the + sign, joins strings on either side of it

var firstName = 'Ivy';
var LastName = 'Stone';
var fullName = firstName + LastName;

/* mixing numbers and strings together */

// When you place quotes around a number, it is a string(not a numeric data type)
// and you cannot perform addition operation on strings.

var cost1 = '7';
var cost2 ='9';
var total =  cost1 + cost2;

// youd end up with a string saying 79
